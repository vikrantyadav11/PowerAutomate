@or(
    equals(item()?['last_active'], null),
    less(formatDateTime(item()?['last_active'], 'yyyy-MM-dd'), formatDateTime(addDays(utcNow(), -90), 'yyyy-MM-dd'))
)


Let's break this down:

equals(item()?['last_active'], null): This checks if last_active is null.
less(formatDateTime(item()?['last_active'], 'yyyy-MM-dd'), formatDateTime(addDays(utcNow(), -90), 'yyyy-MM-dd')): This checks if last_active is less than 90 days from the current date.
By combining these conditions with an or operator, the filter will keep items where last_active is either null or within the last 90 days.

Here's how you would implement it in the Filter array action:

In the Filter array action, set the "From" field to your array variable.
In the "Condition" field, use the above expression.
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to set this up in your logic app:

Add the Filter array action:

Select your array variable for the "From" field.
Configure the condition:

Click on "Edit in advanced mode".
Paste the following expression:
expression
Copy code
@or(
    equals(item()?['last_active'], null),
    less(formatDateTime(item()?['last_active'], 'yyyy-MM-dd'), formatDateTime(addDays(utcNow(), -90), 'yyyy-MM-dd'))
)
This setup will ensure that accounts with a last_active date of null or less than 90 days from the current date will be included in the filtered array.
